      I am a composer and sound designer with over a decade of experience in the intersection of music, sound, and technology. My expertise lies in audio production and composition, where I can seamlessly blend high-quality sound assets with engaging narratives. My diverse portfolio includes composing for various media forms such as film, TV, video games, and spoken word. I have had the privilege to work with clients like BigRock, Cairn Housing Association, and Blackwood Homes and Care, creating bespoke sound solutions tailored to their unique needs.<br/><br/>

      I am also the founder of the Chroma Project, a free and open-source software company, under which I develop audio plug-ins. One such project employs a generative adversarial neural network, which outputs audio samples through the exploration of a latent space based on a large dataset of raw audio. I have also built a pitch tracker which based on monophonic audio input, creates a histogram visualisation of the pitch contour and can convert the estimated frequency into MPE midi data. These projects have given me the confidence to learn highly technical subjects in a self-supervised manner and to apply the knowledge in creative ways.<br/><br/>

      I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing in fostering innovation in creative and technical spaces. I am excited about applying my skillset to solve real-world audio problems and eager to learn from colleagues and mentors in the field.<br/><br/>

      Currently, I am completing my Master's Degree in Sound Design at the University of Edinburgh, with an expected graduation in September 2023. I am excited about the prospect of using my expertise to create innovative solutions in the commercial world and look forward to working on new and exciting products.
